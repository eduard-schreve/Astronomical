Welcome to the first official release of astronomical. It has been a long journey and I still have a lot of bugs i know of and am looking into, but there is still a lot of working code that I belive every game developer can use for the bettering of a game. So for those that are still reading congadulations and hop on in and explore the code

!!!WARNING!!!
some of this code might not work or is highly bugged
